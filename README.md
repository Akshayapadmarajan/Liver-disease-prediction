#  Liver Disease Classification 
This machine learning project uses clinical data to classify patients into different stages of liver disease, including Hepatitis, Fibrosis, and Cirrhosis. The model is trained and evaluated using supervised learning techniques.

## Dataset

- **Source:** [Hepatitis C Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/hepatitis-c-dataset/data)
- **Samples:** 615
- **Features:** Age, Sex, liver enzyme levels (ALT, AST, ALP), bilirubin, proteins, cholesterol, etc.
- **Target:** `Category` â€” representing stages:
  - 0: Blood Donor
  - 0s: Suspect Blood Donor
  - 1: Hepatitis
  - 2: Fibrosis
  - 3: Cirrhosis

##  Objectives

- Load and explore the dataset
- Preprocess the data: handle null values, encode categorical variables
- Train and evaluate multiple classification models
- Compare model performance based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`, `numpy` for data handling
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for visualization
  - `scikit-learn` for ML modeling and evaluation



##  How to Run

1. Clone the repository (or download the `.ipynb` notebook)

git clone https://github.com/Akshayapadmarajan/Liver-disease-prediction.git 
cd liver-disease-classification

jupyter notebook LiverDiseasePredictionProgramMain.ipynb
